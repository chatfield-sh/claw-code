# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Detected stack
- Languages: Rust.
- Frameworks: none detected from the supported starter markers.

## Verification
- Run Rust verification from `rust/`: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`
- `src/` and `tests/` are both present; update both surfaces together when behavior changes.
- `invoice-extract/` is a standalone Python tool with its own suite: `pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest` from that directory. It shares no code with the Rust workspace.

## Repository shape
- `rust/` contains the Rust workspace and active CLI/runtime implementation.
- `src/` contains source files that should stay consistent with generated guidance and tests.
- `tests/` contains validation surfaces that should be reviewed alongside code changes.
- `invoice-extract/` is an unrelated Python CLI that reads scanned supplier invoices into an accounting upload sheet; it is not part of the `claw` runtime.

## Working agreement
- Prefer small, reviewable changes and keep generated bootstrap files aligned with actual repo workflows.
- Keep shared defaults in `.claude.json`; reserve `.claude/settings.local.json` for machine-local overrides.
- Do not overwrite existing `CLAUDE.md` content automatically; update it intentionally when repo workflows change.
